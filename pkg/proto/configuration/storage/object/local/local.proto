// The local object storage backend is responsible for storing objects
// either in memory or on disk. It works by writing all objects to a
// ring buffer named the location-blob map. A hash map named the
// reference-location map is subsequently used to store where a given
// record is stored in the location-blob map.
//
// The ring buffer is partitioned into three regions named "old",
// "current" and "new". These regions denote how likely it is that the
// data is overwritten in the nearby future. Data in the "new" region is
// unlikely to be overwritten, while data in the "old" region is at
// risk. This is why objects stored in the "old" region will be
// refreshed (i.e., copied to the end of the ring buffer) when accessed.
// Data in the "new" region will not be refreshed. Data in the "current"
// region is refreshed with a linear probability that increases the
// closer the object gets to the "old" region, which is done to amortize
// the amount of refreshing that is performed.
//
// Below is an illustration of how the location-blob map may be laid out
// at a given point in time.
//
//      ← Over time, data moves from "new" to "current" to "old" ←
//                    Old     │   Current   │     New
//               █████████████│█████████████│█████████████

//               └┴┴┴┴┴┴┴┴┴┴┴┴─┴─┴───┴─────┴──────────────┘
//    Data is copied from "old" and "current" past "new" when requested.
//
// The size of the "old" region should not be too small, as this would
// cause this storage backend to become a FIFO instead of being
// LRU-like. Making "old" and "current" too large is also not
// recommended, as this would increase redundancy in the data stored.
